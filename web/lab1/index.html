			<p><b>Alex Joens' Views:</b></p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Jones is a vocal gun rights advocate. MTV labeled him a "staunch Second
					Amendment supporter", while the London Daily Telegraph called him a "gun-nut".
					He has been widely quoted in international media for claiming, in a debate with
					Piers Morgan, that "1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms".
					Jones was referencing the American Revolutionary War in relation to theoretical gun
					control measures taken by the government. He has been reported to own around 50
					firearms.
				</li>
				<br></br>
				<li>
					Jones is well-known and widely reported in media for both his opposition to vaccines,
					and his views on vaccine controversies. On June 16, 2017, Vox covered his
					claim that the introduction of the Sesame Street character Julia, an autistic Muppet,
					was "designed to normalize autism, a disorder caused by vaccines." On November 20, 2017,
					The New Yorker quoted Jones as claiming Infowars was "defending people's right to not be
					forcibly infected with vaccines". ThinkProgress have declared that he "continues to
					endanger children by convincing their parents that vaccines are dangerous." Jones
					has specifically disputed the safety and effectiveness of MMR vaccines.
				</li>
				<br></br>
				<li>
					Mother Jones has claimed that Jones is a believer in weather weapons, and Salon
					has covered his claim "that the president has access to weather weapons capable of not
					only creating tornadoes but also moving them around, on demand". His belief in
					weather warfare has been reported by mainstream media. He has claimed
					that Hurricane Irma may have been geo-engineered.
				</li>
				<br></br>
				<li>
					Jones has promoted the white genocide conspiracy theory. Media Matters covered his
					claim that NFL players protesting during the national anthem were "kneeling to white
					genocide" and violence against whites, which the SPLC featured in
					their headlines review. On October 2, 2017, Jones claimed that Democrats and
					communists were plotting imminent "white genocide" attacks. His reporting and
					public views on the topic have received support and coverage from white nationalist
					publications and groups, such as AltRight.com and the New Zealand National Front.
