//Write a program that, given a graph with costs and two vertices, finds a lowest cost walk between the given
//vertices, or prints a message if there are negative cost cycles accessible from the starting vertex.
//The program will use a matrix defined as d[x,k]=the cost of the lowest cost walk from s to x and of
//length equal to k, where s is the starting vertex.
